# This will be our beautiful journey into diving to the magic of C++

But first.. `let me take a selfie ðŸ¤³`. 

Ok, no... 

But first, why use C++? 

> The biggest reason for using C++ is the direct control over the computer hardware. 

So, how C++ works? 

 1. We write our code into C++
 2. We pass it over to our compiler 
 3. The compiler will output machine code translated from the C++ code to our targeted platform

> Machine code are the actual instructions that the cpu itself will follow and perform. So by using C++ we can control every single instruction that our CPU executes. 

But why and how C++ differs for example from C# or Java and why everyone says that it's faster? 

Well C# or Java differ from C++ because they run on a virtual machine. What does that mean? 
This means that our code gets compiled into an intermediate language first, and then when we actually run our application on that target platform, the VM (virtual machine) will basically convert it into machine code at run time! 

But why does that make C# or Java actually slower than C++? 

Well let's give an example here. 

Imagine that you are Greek and you want to buy a book written in Greek language so you can read it, but instead you are in a book store that only sells English written books, but you don't know any English at all, so the book store also gives you alongside the book a "live" translator. So when you get home to read the book, basically the translator reads the book in English but translates it in real time as he reads it into Greek for you to understand it. But of course you can imagine that, that is not as efficient as if the book was originally in Greek sold in a Greek book store so you could take it and immediately read it yourself in the language that you understand without a need for a translator. 

Well that's the difference between C# or Java and C++ and why C++ is closer to the hardware and faster than those other 2 languages. (We're currently talking about languages that have to be compiled and not for interpretted languages.) 

C++ can be directly translated into machine code via the compiler for the CPU to understand, while C# or Java need to first be translated into an "intermediate" language and then that "intermediate" language will have to be translated into machine code on run time from the VM compiler. 

See the extra step here? Good. 

So let's dive into the magic of C++
